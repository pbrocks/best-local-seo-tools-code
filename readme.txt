Welcome to the Democratized Future of Great SEO!

The new Best Local SEO Tools wordpress plugin levels the playing field and affordably enables small businesses and blogs to affordably, quickly, and recurringly SEO their website using advanced artificial intelligence (AI), provides an easy way for blogs and ecommerce sites to quickly boost their traffic, gives small and mid-size businesses the same powerful local search dominating technologies that the big directories like Yelp, YellowPages & AngiesList use, helps businesses boost their maps presence, enables businesses to easily generate and showcase great & authentic feedback, testimonials & online reviews, and takes only about 15 minutes to set up! Even better – it has a powerful free version for your site / blog, so why not give it a try? You have like nothing to lose!

It's designed and built by a search engine optimization industry veteran with over a decade of local search engine optimization experience, who has also worked on some of the world's largest websites, so you can be confident that it's designed to scale for your site's traffic needs. Even if you don't have a Wordpress site, you can just pick a good domain name and some Wordpress hosting, put in a theme and some unique content, set up our system and link to it from your old site, and you'll likely start seeing strong results in around 7 days. While the plugin is easy to set up, it also offers an enormous amount of advanced controls so you can make even the finer details of the plugin work according to your preferences.

Showcase Your Work & Testimonials to Dominate Local SEO with the Technology the Big Directories Use

Big directories like Yelp, YellowPages & Angieslist rank in lots of cities because their content is organized into an optimized directory page for each city with strong internal linking. This plugin automatically does the same for your site in the area you serve with your portfolio, projects, clients & testimonials as your expertly automatically search engine optimized local content with technologies that intelligently package your content into a locally browseable hierarchy. Just install the plugin, set your key phrase, location and service radius, add portfolio items, and you can start watching for the earned traffic to start quickly flooding in! It's even designed to also help improve your rankings in "map-pack" listings after Google's Pigeon update gave much more weighting to organic signals, and as your business grows, the plugin can grow and expand with you and your service area.

Easily Get Feedback & Generate Five Star Reviews

The Reputation Builder included in Best Local SEO Tools is a great way to request feedback and generate great & authentic online reviews, and is built into the plugin. The system allows you to request testimonials and / or prompt reviews from customers on a landing page on your site. You can mail customers individually or en masse to leave you feedback, or even set up a feedback kiosk in your store. You can then moderate their review and testimonial for publishing on your site, and if their review score is above a threshold that you define (ie 4 stars or higher), after submitting their review / testimonial on your site, you can automatically prompt them to review your business on other reviews sites you have specified like Google, Yelp & more, with easy-to-click links to your profiles for them to quickly review you there! This helps you generate authentic, positive reviews online and increases your credibility with Google and other sites. Surveys have shown having such reviews to be another way to rank higher in Google as well. If their score is below your goal rating, you'll have a chance to know it and reach out to them before they leave a bad rating for you online somewhere. Online reviews have repeatedly been shown by studies to be a huge factor in what businesses consumers choose to work with. With our Reputation Builder, you'll be able to not only improve your business with feedback, but also help generate the online social proof that your potential customers are looking for.

Keep Your Site Content Fresh with Best Local SEO Tools’ Next Generation Portfolio Of Your Work & Testimonials

You can also use the system as a site's main portfolio as it is designed to be extensible and themeable using Wordpress' built-in template hierarchy and taxonomy systems. The system is thoroughly extendable so Wordpress developers and designers can easily integrate it into their existing workflows, and also works with Advanced Custom Fields. Already have a portfolio? You can use a plugin to switch its post type to localproject, and then merge your portfolio into this plugin (probably with some minimal theme adjusting required as well).

Data requests to and from the plugin / your website to the geographic data API are performed as you use the plugin or as website users view code rendered through the plugin, and by using our plugin, data may be sent from our servers to your website and from your website to our servers.

The plugin needs to send data back-and-forth from your site to work for our servers to retrieve geographic data, for usage tracking, and for notifications. More info is at http://www.bestlocalseotools.com
